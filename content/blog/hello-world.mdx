# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Next.js and MDX. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Why I Started This Blog

I created this blog to share my insights about:

- Software Engineering
- Technology Trends
- Personal Projects
- Career Growth

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a React component:

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about technology, software development, and my journey as a software engineer.
